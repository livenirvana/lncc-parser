Kurt was Barney (with a bottle of Jack Daniel's in his hand, which he apparently chugged through the mask's mesh mouth and the tail tied between the leg), Pat was Slash, Dave was a mummy, and Krist was a white-faced \"reverse Ted Danson\" with \"P.C.\" on his forehead for \"Politically Correct.\" (The actor Ted Danson had recently been ridiculed for making a public appearance in black-face with his girlfriend Whoopi Goldberg.) At some point, Kurt changed his costume and came back to the stage with fairy wings and a big black moustache drawn on his face.",
        "After \"About A Girl\", someone in the audience threw a shoe at Kurt. Kurt took the shoe, urinated in it, and then asked who the shoe belonged to. The shoeâ€™s owner replied that it was thrown onstage by someone else. Kurt apologized and said he would have to buy the person a newpair of shoes."
