        "Dave and Krist started to play “Lounge Act”, but Kurt was looking for a left handed guitar. He got a untuned one and Krist got upset because he took so long to tune up while the band keep playing the song. Krist hurled his bass at Kurt (or at the floor/speakers) and walked offstage. The band was under contract to play for 90 minutes, so the crew had to retrieve Krist to finish the set. When Krist returned, he picked up his tossed bass from the stage and didn't bother to retune it or swap it out.",
