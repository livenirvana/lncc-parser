When Kurt was handed his guitar and told that they would have to play on opposite sides of the stage, he expressed concern and said they had never played that way before (although they did on at least 08/24/91). With the exception of <cite>Saturday Night Live</cite>, Kurt and Krist maintained their new sides of the stage at all future shows."
