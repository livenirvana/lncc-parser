Sooo... we leave the concert hall with his pompous draperies and enormous cushioned seats, we leave the carcasses of the audience, their souls and ears bleeding and hot, their mouths and eyes agog, come on! Their limbs twitching as in a death throw, we leave them all in the keeping of that sombre horn. The siren of moon madness. The lunatic stern voice and as we step across the carpet, down the aisle and across the threshold of the exit door, we hear the orchestra awaken from their swoon. Their strange nightmare, we hear the conductor tapping his baton against the podium, then they all take up their parts, weakly at first, but finally booming away noisily, their notes rain down on the audience, whose rotting spirits shut them up, bloating themselves on all that foolish tinkling and banging, Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! And now the mystery guest, er... with freeze dried music... Nir-vana!",
