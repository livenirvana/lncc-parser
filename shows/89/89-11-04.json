According to an attendee, the band only played for about 25 minutes before this.\nAccording to a review, maybe during the last song \"About A Girl\" (or during another part of the concert), Kurt layed on stage, did some stunts and started/finished the song/jam without playing guitar at all. Kurt also sang/played a song sitting/jumping while on Krist's shoulders, destroyed the strings of his bass and threw it away.",
