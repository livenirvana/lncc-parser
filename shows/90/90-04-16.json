He grabbed a chair and a table and put them on stage then sat down and played. Then kicked the chair and table around, went off the stage and started throwing bottles at the wall behind Chad, then the audience started doing the same. The promoter walked on stage dodging bottles beseeching the crowd to stop. Krist had to be carried off stage because he was barefoot."
